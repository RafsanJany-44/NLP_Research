there is nothing else like khan academy out there for improving your academic skills. they are cutting edge for learning.,1.0
"sal is amazing. so is chemistry. i really really wish my school teacher could teach chemistry like this. unfortunately, he didn&#39;t and the chemistry class for me turned out to be all about memorising the periodic table, drawing the structure of all molecules. never thinking about why and how. i then became a computer science engineer. at the age of 36, which is right now, i realise my real passion is in chemistry. for all the students who are reading this, sometimes the teacher is just not good and please try to learn from somewhere else. don&#39;t lose your curiosity about the world. i lost it when i was so young and i want to find it back right now.",1.0
"thanks khan academy! wish i had this series when i was in school, would have helped so much and inspired so many interest i came upon naturally.glad this is out there for the interested kids today!",1.0
"this was a really helpful video in understanding what the essence of chemistry is. you really put it into perspective for me when you said that even though we haven&#39;t figured it all out, we can still make use of the functional aspects of math and physics and use it to explain things in our universe. great video!",1.0
"always stuns me how the study of the minute blocks of matter that make up the existence we live in can be the most overlooked of the three core sciences. always pleased to see khan academy bearing the flag for chemistry, helped me get through all levels of my education and shaped me into the scientist i am today!",1.0
"wow, i have a doctorate from cornell, but never had a teacher like this.this guy is excellent. i&#39;m hooked.",1.0
studying chemistry for years & now it makes sense,1.0
"in my previous school the only subject we covered in science was biology makin me very behind in both chemistry and physics, this is really helpful tnx. (i&#39;m 14 and about to start my gcses)",1.0
"thanks khan academy! right when i was feeling down about chemistry at the end of the semester you&#39;ve brought me back around, like always! chemistry is awesome!!",1.0
wow. im 10 yet i can still do various chemistry problems and even calculus all because of khan academy. i owe a huge thank you to you sal and everyone at khan academy for helping me dedicating my life to learn and even making it a full time hobby of mine.,1.0
thank you beyond belief khan - this is what i&#39;ve needed since school.. you&#39;ve created an outstanding academy.. i&#39;m a big fan ,1.0
"thats a motivational video,  even though i gone through medical studies, now feels important to study  chemistry in deep to understand basics which doctors cannot explain",1.0
"my 10yo has been using ka for several years and is currently using their coding, 4th grade math and grammar lessons. my 6yo uses their khan academy kids app and their 2nd grade math lessons. i pull from ka&#39;s world history and science lessons to teach both of my youngest boys together. they both love studying space and their queries have lead us to needing vids/lessons about chemistry. i knew i could look to ka to teach complex concepts in a clear and interesting way, so here i am...adding this vid to my lesson plans at 2am heh",1.0
heyyy mr. khan..... u are doing an awesome job... hats off to your teaching.... keep on going....,1.0
"sal you are an awesome individual , i am gleaning from your discourse that you have an understanding far beyond these simplistic topics you are teaching",1.0
people who are just starting out in chem101 typically do ignore the periodic table because they have seen it most of their lives (me included in the beginning). i think a goal that all introductory teachers should have is making the table mystifying again. it&#39;s one of those things that you will never see the same way once it is accurately explained to you.,1.0
"its interesting how weve separated them. because theres overlap sometimes. its mentioned in the video how there is overlap. like for example the way light enters the eye, thats not just a biological thing. thats also physics. and then the neurons in the brain, there is a lot of potassium and sodium stuff going on which i am still learning about. ions, positive charges, negative charges. it would be be good to have a theory of everything.",1.0
"i love this video. i love how i can feel the excitement of the speaker. it makes me wanna go deep into different fields of sciences, not just chemistry:d keep it up! you make studying fun and exciting for us.",1.0
"chemistry is so cool! i really thought science was just science but noooo theres physics and biology and many more! everything we see around us is related to science and more specifically chemistry?? wow that is so cool! thank you khan academy, this made me look at our world in a different perspective. you are cool too  keep it up !",1.0
sal got me thru linear algebra and stats ten years ago and now is helping me with chemistry for vet science :) thank you,1.0
"thank you. i&#39;m not even out of elementary school,and i&#39;m studying to become a chemical engineer. this helped me understand what chemistry means thank you!",1.0
"this is a wonderful introduction! exactly what i was looking for!  my mind thirsts for interconnectedness, the gestalt and the micro, and how it all fits together i always loved and excelled in biolog, but never felt i had a handle on chemistry not for lack of wanting(im 51 now), but still am fascinated with science, and yearn for deep integration.  thank you!  youre a great teacher!, im looking forward to the next lesson ",1.0
"after reading the comments, i feel so blessed i watched this video before starting to learn actual chemistry.",1.0
i love how he talks about maths as a common language. he loves maths. :),1.0
very nice presentation keep the good work,1.0
"i always wanted to study chemistry, but not the school-way. during my highschool years i never understood, ""why the hell am i studying this what&#39;s this for how can i visualize this i cant what&#39;s the point of this"" no one ever taught me to learn chemistry and relate it to what&#39;s happening around us. this is why i want to learn it by myself, here in youtube. i hope chemistry will one day make sense to me. i love chemistry but i hate that i dont get it, i can&#39;t relate it to the environment. unfortunately for me, my course pharmacy has alot of chemistry and my first year will start in a few weeks. i really want to not just study but understand chemistry before college starts.",1.0
"you guys are great. a fluid when supercooled, only freezes because of acoustics. if completely it won&#39;t freeze, even at absolute zero.very cold beverages ahead!",1.0
really engaging introduction to chemistry.,1.0
the true essence of chemistry is the mystery it holds inside that lights the curiosity of humans to explore,1.0
great pep talk for the study of chemistry....whets your appetite for more!  ,1.0
"i&#39;m trying to find a new hobby for the summer and i always wanted to understand chemistry, so here we are",1.0
one of the beauty of learning chemistry is that you know from the back of your mind some being from exoplanets are studying it too and we obey same physical law,1.0
great video! hope theres more to come :d,1.0
chemistry is so easy if this is the kind of professors we have.,1.0
he talks with so much passion,1.0
love this video. this is why i study chemistry!,1.0
awesome intro!!!! i finally grasp the definition of chemistry. love listening to your voice!,1.0

"mad scientists are, indeed, a very important part of chemistry! i struggle to believe all of the people that got us here were where completely sane.",1.0
you guys are perfect.thank u so much:)),1.0
love this vid i now see why i  picked this subject at school hearing about it sounds fun,1.0
"i have never been so intrested , fascinated and impressed by any thing.",1.0
"everyone talks about how lucky we are to be living in a time period that&#39;s so advanced where we have all the answers, but that&#39;s probably what everyone thought. back in medieval china, they probably felt lucky since at the time they were living with all the answers. and in a couple hundred years, those people will be talking about how lucky they are since they get all the answers. the only reason we feel lucky and think we know all the answers is because we haven&#39;t seen what the future is like. we can look back on medieval china and think, ""wow, did they really do that? i can&#39;t believe they thought those things! they&#39;re so un-advanced compared to us now."" but in a few hundred years, thats how people will view our lives! it&#39;s all a matter of perspective: every time you live in is a lucky time to live in as long as you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re missing. but if you do know what you&#39;re missing, then no matter what time you live in, you&#39;ll know things could be way better. essentially, what i am trying to say is that everyone views the time period they live in as the best time to be alive. it may not be logically true, but as long as you believe it, then it is.",1.0
wow i love you man.  i want the full answer. you and i are both passionate about knowledge thinking and nature. you are so close to a beginning religion in this video. not but sort of. what elements are formed in black holes? or quasars? red dwarfs? green goblins? joke. you are awesome khan.  the great khan.,1.0
excellent series.,1.0
"thank you gys, as usual. great intrnational communitarian work. keep it on!",1.0
"an atom has different chemical and physical characteristics before and after chemical reaction. this is because either photons will be dissipated out to the surroundings or absorbed from the surroundings from the atom during the reaction. in other words, the different saturation of photons on its nucleons will cause different flexure to the unique nucleus structure therefore the atom has different chemical and physical characteristics before and after chemical reaction. different flexure of the unique nucleus structure will mold different orientation and configuration of its electrons before and after chemical reaction. in other words, the different flexure of unique nucleus structure will mold its orbitals therefore the atomhas different chemical and physical characteristics. how we know this is true?einstein&#39;s famous equation, e=mc^2 is wrong otherwise garbage also can be used to make nuclear bombs as long as it is matter or it has mass. energy and matter can&#39;t interchange one another according to einstein&#39;s famous equation. one must have photons before one can emit out photons. photons are particles and they have mass. all forms of emws including light and heat are dynamic photons per volume per time in different saturations. precisely, chemical energy is also dynamic photons per volume per time in specific saturations. if you are interested in real discoveries, i would recommend you to read my book, the unification theory - volume one and you will be amazed with lots of new, interesting discoveries. in god i trust.",1.0
this teacher has a passion for chemistry.,1.0
i luv khan academy we went through everything together,1.0
i earned my ba in 2015. took stats to fulfill the gen ed requirements. enrolled in intro chem soon.. can someone suggest what kind of math i should brush up on if it will help? thank you.,1.0
"school fails to show this in the light it deserves. its all about standardized testing and making students. it should be about the discovery of life, reality, and truth. i think it was sweden that lets kids pick what they wanna be, then tailors them throughout schooling to be the best in their fields.",1.0
"i think brilliant light power has chemistry completely figured out. chemical design + synthesis can now be done on a computer, and a program can decide the best routes of synthesis.",1.0
"loved this video, helped out a lot!",1.0
chemistry is the programming language of the universe!!,1.0
hello khan academy actually i was stuck at chemical reactions arent khan academy teaching displacement reactions? i logged in khan academy as well but i cannot find a single video of displacement reactionsi would be thankful for your kindly reply,1.0
i have never done chemistry until uni and i was actually having a mental breakdown before watching this :&#39;( thank you for shedding some light onto me,1.0

"oh, its khan academy, ill definetly want to donate to this, its very helpful when i want to know how things work.",1.0
your voice is perfect for thisedit1. i think learning other languages through math would be easy af cause 1+1 would be easy to explain even through sing language or charadesedit 2 trust me i know man dr stone the anime opened my eyes to what chemistry coule do it ciuls rebuild our civilization in no time if you could find the right stuff and the us is huge compared to most countries so im sure we could find most of it here,1.0

"awesome, thank you",1.0
"would you please urgently answer this question: cl atom ,for example, has 17 positive protons and 17 negative electrons so that the atom has to be this way uncharged or charge-balanced, why then in nature it tends to dorm covalent bond with another cl atom or ionic bond with h?",1.0

khan academy + crash course > school,1.0
"in 2017 i was working in it support mainly in windows environments.i wanted to do something different and found these videos. i followed your videos every day and when i felt comfortable enough i also started setting up a lab environment that was meant to replicate how an enterprise environment is set up using kvm.after about 5 months of a minimum of 3 hours per day learning, i felt comfortable enough to add linux and some other skills to my linkedin profile. a few weeks after that i got a call from arecruiter and eventually landed my first linux sysadmin job. this was in the beginning of 2018.i&#39;m still at the same job, however the position has developed into more of a devops type of role and i work in aws, kubernetes and everything is infrastructure as code nowadays. i&#39;ve learned so much these past 4 years and i really love my job and how the industry constantly changes.i just want to thank you for making these videos that allowed me to be where i am today. what you do is invaluable.",
"took a linux course few years back and the guy made it seem impossible to learn, been playing on my own for awhile but this is by far the best i&#39;ve come across! thank you very much! will be continuing my journey &amp; excited to do so!",1.0
i just wanted to come back here and say despite the fact that these videos are slightly on the old side they are excellent. this is quite literately all you need and then some if you&#39;re a software engineer working on a linux platform.,1.0
the most important thing that i have taken away from this series so far is that there is at least one person on this planet who knows how to post a video tutorial series... my biggest pet peeve is going to someone&#39;s channel for a series and its either posted in reverse or only partially completed. so thank you for the series and for knowing how to upload videos in order lol,1.0
"i commit myself for 30 day&#39;s to your course. thanks for putting this together, my whole house already runs linux. i started my own business in virtualization. so this is a great way to become a sysadmin in linux, i absolutely love it, and after your course i hope i can rent myself to companies as a linux sysadmin! stay tuned! and thanks for beign awesome!",1.0
thanks so much for making this course dave. this is exactly what i need to get started with linux and terminal. i have only watched a few so far but i have learned a lot.,1.0
this linux tutorial series is awesome! i have learned so much from your videos. i have watched your entire series. i would love to see you do a series on setting up more services like apache or php. keep up the good work@,1.0
"thanks you so much for these courses. i&#39;ve been working as a sysadmin of backups &amp; storage tools, using linux and unix a lot, but never as a real linux/unix admin, only editing files, changing permissions mounting and dismounting, and that type of basic operative tasks. now i&#39;m taking this course and practicing and understanding at a much deeper level what i&#39;ve been doing all these years. hopefully, i could switch my career to linux admin. gotta admit that the aix smitty tool for installing, upgrading, etc, is really powerful. linux could benefit from something like that.",1.0
recently started taking an interest into linux and becoming a sysadmin one day. will come back in a year to update how the journey is going. thank you so much for this course,1.0
"hey man loving your videos so far keep doing a great job, my cs degree program is about this fall and i plan to develop on linux but as i am right now (having no knowledge of linux basically used windows all my life, and have become pretty tires of it because of windows 10), fortunately i came unto your  channel. i have been researching for past few days and have gotten used to linux specific terminology. what distro wouls you recommend to  me a beginner to learn development primarily c++ and python along with system administration. there has to be a linux distro that has all of it straped and ready for my use without me needing to manually configure anything...i did use lubuntu a few years and i just ran back to win 7.please help and thanks for your service to the linux community",1.0
"just want to say thank you. your vids gave me the confidence and knowledge i needed to score a job working at google. i&#39;ve known a little about linux for awhile, but the way you present the info here made it possible to learn what i needed in order  to do what had to be done. so thank you kindly brother!",1.0
"i am studying for a new job right now, you have no idea how helpful you have been with these videos.wherever you are, i hope that you are doing well.",1.0
"dave, thank you so much for taking the time and effort to create and post these videos!",1.0
"greatest playlist ever created for linux. i remember going through the playlist an year or two back and having remembered how good you were, i specifically searched &amp; found you again &amp; now again going through the whole playlist to brush up my skills. you da man!",1.0
i am rewatching this series and learning a lot. thank you for creating this!,1.0
"loved this series.  first one that made using the terminal easy and manageable (for me anyway).switched over fully from windows about 3 months ago even though i&#39;ve been playing with linux on and off for about 6-7 years.  loving every minute at the moment (can&#39;t say the same about previous experiences).  linux is getting better and better and imho has far surpassed windows (for me).  shells should come with a &quot;he who dares, wins&quot; message upon first startup.",1.0
thanks for this course. it will improve my basic knowledge of system administration that i did not learn during college. a good way to spent time on the pandemic.,1.0
"hi,first i would like to say thank you for sharing this great knowledge. second, this is a great tutorial and please keep posting more of this excellent material.merry christmas everyone ...",1.0
"hey buddy, i got a sysadmin job for a major company, and i didn&#39;t know how much i loved this stuff until i started. i&#39;m taking your course to hopefully expand my career in something i love, and i cant thank you enough for putting  this up. cant wait to start.",1.0
"super awesome playlist and course, really. learned some at the course of my current job as qa, but want to advance towards sysadmin through the next year or so.wanted to ask, is this course still viable? i do know that it covers pretty much everything i&#39;m gonna need to know, but if there&#39;s something that was updated or need to learn besides this, i&#39;d be happy to know!",1.0
"thanks for this vid! very helpful for a windows tech support like me, planning to dive deeper into linux.",1.0

"hi, dave!  i&#39;m just about to begin dealing with a linux server for work, and started you-tubing it, when i came across your sysadmin course intro. awesome stuff!  great job on presentation, articulation, material knowledge etc.   i noticed that there are 12 videos in this series, and was curious if you&#39;re planning on creating additional videos related to this topic?   if so, when?  tx so very much!",1.0
"thanks for so detailed video for beginners! dude, you do it really great!",1.0
"i&#39;ve been using linux for years but it&#39;s not until now that i&#39;ve been interested in anything beyond the dirt floor basics (that is to say, beyond apt-get, pretty much), and it&#39;s because a friend of mine introduced me to using linux in bioinformatics, since there&#39;s a massive store of non-profit applications written in this field that anyone can use.so thanks for making these videos.also &quot;command line heavy&quot; is probably what most people watching this wants to hear, i sure know i do xdit&#39;s not like anyone needs a tutorial in the gui based stuff since it&#39;s more or less exactly like windows these days.",1.0
+100 man. finally had enough of windows and totally replaced windows with ubuntu on my only computer. i didnt even want to set up a dual boot or shell; just jumping in the deep end.hope this crash course into linux is as good as it seems!,1.0
hey tutoriallinux! thanks for these videos. it would be really helpful if you could recommend some book to follow along with this course,1.0
wow ! sounds promising. i am very excited and curious. i take your word and start learning from today. thank you very much for being very generous.,1.0
these should be fun videos. i&#39;ve got a fair amount of experience(and it&#39;s been my daily driver for years) but there are definitely holes in my understanding.,1.0
"dave, this intro has got me very excited to learn linux, thank you!",1.0
"decided to learn linux over the summer. this series sounds promising, thank you for posting!",1.0
this is gold!!!...thank you so much for your help and contribution .,1.0
you can say those exact words in 2021 and still up to date! thank you,1.0
"wow, thanks so much for these!  so so helpful sir, i really appreciate it!!     subbed.  cheers.",1.0
hi i am starting this course and following all the videos i may be late but better late than never. i will try to finish the videos over this bank holiday weekend (i got 4 days of full learning to do). or do you recommend i take my time and spread out the videos. i&#39;ll keep you guys updated with my progress!,1.0

"dave, first of all, let me say you are a frakkin hero for posting all these videos. i have already been through 3 different videos, and i am really liking it.i had a question for you :do you think a linux+ certification will be helpful for a beginner looking to get into the linux-admin job market ?",1.0
"quick question / ask: is there any way you can put in the 1st video description, or on a blog post somewhere every single linux tool that has to be downloaded/installed for the entire program? i watch your videos from the office where my proxy prevents me from actually apt-get&#39;ting things. (the repo rejects my connection request) it would be ultra handy if i had a list of all the little apps and modules ahead of time so i can pre-install them prior to starting to &#39;course&#39;. could you put a quick blog post up on https://tutorialinux.com for those of us who prefer (or need to) install all of these ahead of time? secondly, in this video you mention you&#39;re not going down the pentesting road &quot;too far&quot;. can you recommend a similar resource for someone that may want to adventure that way after this? thanks! thanks for taking the time to put out quality content like this. i look forward to going through the entirety of your video program.edit: for anyone who wants another way to practice what you&#39;re learning here, check out overthewire wargames. they&#39;re ssh linux instances set up in ways that present a challenge or a problem that you have to solve using command line tools in linux. a great way to enforce the learning material we&#39;re getting from here. http://overthewire.org/wargames/",1.0

"i hear so many good things about linux and its true i just started experimenting with ubuntu. the way linux feels to me is like using cydia on an iphone. -its very basic and hollow. -things are not readily available and not very fluent as lets say the mac. -if you need any app, you download it, and hopefully it will install if the &#39;dependencies&#39; are met. -all these apps look like some kid made them in his basement. do i feel comfortable installing them on my system.-why would a windows/mac user know anything about &#39;dependencies&#39; and sudo commands. -have you ever seen a mac/pc casual-user go into dos and type in commands to make apps install properly?  -even when it installs you don&#39;t know where it went. you see what i am trying to say here. there is no method or fluidity to ubuntu 16.0 to be specific. this is why windows and mac sell, because they understand that you need that feeling that apps are readily available on the dock or in the start menu and when you hover them they magnify and when you click on them they open. unlike ubuntu you don&#39;t even know if you clicked the taskbar app, you don&#39;t even know if is on. any app you open loves to take over the entire screen. like really i wasn&#39;t doing anything important before that, was i? yes sure i can put the apps i like in the bar and switch off the snap-to-edges option, but why should i have to ?ease of use is different than not being able to find the damn app in the first place. i will play around with it some more since all the great stuff in the world is based on linux. lolx. but there is a reason mac&#39;s and pc&#39;s sell and this stuff won&#39;t sell but anyone who can put up with it can use it, because its free.",1.0

"i&#39;d just like to interject for a moment. what you&#39;re referring to as linux, is in fact, gnu/linux, or as i&#39;ve recently taken to calling it, gnu plus linux. linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning gnu system made useful by the gnu corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full os as defined by posix._x000D__x000D_many computer users run a modified version of the gnu system every day, without realizing it. through a peculiar turn of events, the version of gnu which is widely used today is often called &quot;linux&quot;, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the gnu system, developed by the gnu project._x000D__x000D_there really is a linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine&#39;s resources to the other programs that you run. the kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. linux is normally used in combination with the gnu operating system: the whole system is basically gnu with linux added, or gnu/linux. all the so-called &quot;linux&quot; distributions are really distributions of gnu/linux.",0.0

"hey! i hope this playlist will be useful to you in learning the basics of tensorflow and i think after going through these videos you will feel comfortable with using tensorflow, doing your own projects, reading official documentations etc. i spent a lot time trying to make them as concise as possible and i think the result is pretty good. feedback is always appreciated!i also learned from and was inspired to make these videos on tensorflow after i completed the tensorflow specialization on coursera. personally i think these videos give a similar understanding but if you wanna check it out you can. below you&#39;ll find both affiliate and non-affiliate links, the pricing for you is the same but a small commission goes back to the channel if you buy it through the affiliate link. affiliate: https://bit.ly/3jyvdvknon-affiliate: https://bit.ly/3qtrk39",1.0
your videos are fantastic. exactly what i was looking for and i looked at a lot of alternatives.,1.0
advice for anyone having issues with the interpreter: the latest version of pycharm was not detecting the interpreter and did not let me manually load the .exe file without errors either. i installed the 2020.2 version of pycharm (as in the video) and that fixed the issue.,1.0
as usual very informative and awesome content. thank you so much.,1.0
great video! i&#39;ve been trying to download tensorflow for a couple days now and this was the first video with helpful insight. thank you!,1.0
do you need to have both tensorflow gpu an cpu or can you pick either? if so what would be the difference between them? i&#39;m planning to use tensorflow for machine learning on images,1.0
ladies and gentlemen. congratulations on discovering the best tensorflow tutorial in the entire freaking world.,1.0
"thank you so much i finally installed tf!! well done, very clear explanation",1.0
i have watched 6 videos till now and all videos give very deep understanding of tensorflow. you are awesome.,1.0

amazing! hope you create a beginners playlist for pytorch also,1.0
hello:dfirst of all thank you for the content. it is easy to follow and understand. i have one question:do i need to install tf for my gpu and cpu? or is it enough to install the only version for the gpu due to the better performance?thank you.br,1.0
"hey man, thanks for making this playlist. i was just wondering, would this playlist be sufficient enough to get a good hold on tensorflow? i meant would this be covering all what is required to be a tensorflow certified developer? ""https://www.tensorflow.org/extras/cert/tf_certificate_candidate_handbook.pdf""planning to give tensorflow exam quite soon. although i have a good hand in deep learning with pytorch (thanks to you again for all your pytorch videos), i just want to get my hands dirty on tensorflow as well. i believe having a knowledge of both is definitely a plus point.so needed a headstart. and i am sure i am in a right place again.",1.0

"hi, i have managed to install tensorflow and verify the version installed. however, when i try to run your model from github, it stops at the first epoch and does not do the others. it also gives me this message: ""this tensorflow binary is optimized with oneapi deep neural network library (onednn) to use the following cpu instructions in performance-critical operations:  avx avx2 to enable them in other operations, rebuild tensorflow with the appropriate compiler flags."" any ideas on what this means?",1.0

"my thoughts :there should be some showcase videos for any new learning.suppose a child have completed his 12 th. and now his father wants to make him in field of engineering. there are different fields in engineering. and that child don&#39;t know which field is what, which field will be more interesting to him. so father should showcase the child about various fields of engineering. that not means to teach every field, father gives short examples of different field, to get little more idea about field. mainly tells the application of the field and connect to near surroundings, or which the child knows. by doing this child knows, which field show more interest to him and also it develops curosity abt the field in the child.this teaching is more on the surface, not deeper, but starting these teachings to child, helps to get what to learn. and children enjoys and need this too, at starting. in starting showcase and exposure is also needed for a child to start in any field.in the same way, i think there s&#39;d be some videos which don&#39;t teach, are just for showing new learners. see the application of this , like basic html, basic css, basic javascript. and enjoying and see things happening.and you the master showing these. this creates curosity in learning new thing or new language. generally teachers teach whole new thing, and makes thing at the last. they apply what they learnt for a long time, after a long time.i think first is to develop curosity, showcase the enjoyment part, that this is this, this works like this, here we have used this, here we used javascript, and see the magic. no need of any concept at starting. give basic idea behind, like html, css or javascript. nothing deep.then in second part, connect the first part, elaborate little basic concepts with application showcase.in third, have all deep concepts, without real showcase, just input output in idle, may be.our mind first don&#39;t want to go deep, it want to be on surface, let it be like that. first make it well on the surface. then one can easily dive into deep anytime. but then it will be wish of the learner. teacher first main aim s&#39;d be to develop curosity, enjoyment in his disciple. not simply to teach. start giving exposure, showcases.",0.0

"on your cruyff move, you need to let that ball travel a little further there making the opponent commit more. but the you way do it, the ball doesn&#39;t move enough sideways keeping your body still  right on top per the ball which gives the defender little incentive to commit.you are doing the &quot;roll over&#39; wrong, which can be seen easily for you&#39;re crossing your legs over. the reason you cross your legs is because your not allowing to turn your body a quarter turn with the ball, instead you keep your body parallel  facing the bal which is very awkward and as result the ball doesn&#39;t travel much. the way to do it is when you roll the ball(i call it stroking it) you turn your body in the direction of the ball, in other words go with it,  which causes the ball to travel much further, thus giving the opponent less chance to even reach for the ball since it is moving too far square to his body. the best thing to do is right after stroking and turning your body with the stroke, is to meet the ball on the return at the furthest point and still able to stroke using the area under the bottom of your toes not the arch when coming back. now here is what is important is when stroking the ball on the return is to always use the area on the bottom of your toes not your arch!! this way you allow the ball to travel further.....",0.0

"adam smith also recognized that government had an important responsibility; which is, to establish &quot;a fair field with no favors.&quot; smith understood that part of our nature is to secure privileges when possible, to use financial and political power interchangeably to do so. he warned against the creation of a &quot;rentier&quot; elite and of cartels whose power was to claim what others produced without having to exchange anything in return. smith understood that the rent of land, of nature, is societal and not individual wealth; he shared with the physiocrats in france the view that rent was the appropriate source of public revenue, that earned income flows and the capital goods we produce should not be burdened by taxation (i.e., by what we call today &quot;dead weight losses&quot;).",1.0

"his explanation of micro and macro economics is easy to understand. i think if every business is based on an invisible hand, easy to control it. but among nations they scheme to get more profits. under such situations economics seems to be kind of a landmark to lead to better solutions. once i heard that economics is drawing fantasy on the panel. this means that an economist is an expert who will know tomorrow why the things he predicted yesterday didn&#39;t happen today, i wonder.  nice video!",1.0

"what adam smith especially meant was, that (in modern game theoretic sense) there should be rules of the game such that the overall outcome is optimal. for me the essence of capitalism is *not* self-interest or exploitation, but rather the use of a stochastic growth process to escape eternal poverty and build wealth.",1.0

"again, &quot;the invisible hand&quot; is often taken out of context. smith studied the welfare of persons and governments, and he is exposing how the flaws of others benefit local capital. it can be argued that those participating in the economy of the time, merchants preferred trade with those that were of similar ethnicity. the name of the book is after all, the wealth of nations, not the wealth of merchants. &quot;by preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention.&quot; -- adam smith",1.0
exceptional presentation in that it emphasises the many caveats that must be added when simplifying assumptions are used to generate the output from the mathematical model.,1.0
thanks man that was a great video! so easy to understand! :-),1.0
"(cont)  he was also worried what great britain was doing to places like india and realized that investors could make much more money investing abroad rather than investing locally while making much less. the context of the &quot;invisible hand&quot; has more to do with a person&#39;s conscience (guiding him to invest at home, but making less, because it was the right thing to do. at least this is how is was taught to me.",1.0

"on the smith quote ending &quot;by pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it.&quot; my version: &quot;by aligning one&#39;s own self-determined interest --both one&#39;s financial interest and passion for one&#39;s craft--with a vision for the greater good of both society and ecosystem, one has truly got it ! here, we can enjoy the innovative pizazz of laissez faire and the (decentralized) cooperative spirit dedicated to holistic ecofriendly lifestyle and celebration of thriving community. today we see the dire effects of both capitalism--unchecked by concern for the environment and labor health--and communism--also unchecked by this concern. welcome to project integrity international!",1.0

"smith also opposed special privilege and monopoly, although in his time he could not denounce landed privilege directly. smith&#39;s treatment of &quot;rent&quot; (i.e., the rent of land) comes as close as he could come to arguing the case for the public collection of the rent of land to pay for public goods and services. to correct your assertion, smith&#39;s french contemporaries the physiocrats were equally as insightful in their writings on political economy. it was francois quesnay who came up with the first input-output flow chart.",1.0

"basically, you have visionaries who create things that drive the economy, and you have those who are ashamed by their lack of vision who believe that by quantifying and defining, and even throttling, the things that the visionary created, they have somehow contributed to the vision. in 1776 the free thinking visionaries were the founder of the united states and the british were the one&#39;s who&#39;s grip on social definitions were threatened by the new way of thinking. this battle is still being played out every day in this country a million times over. unfortunately, computers have given those who think they can define and control creativity the upper hand. and they are using them in an attempt to control the human spirit and limit free thinking to only those ideas that have been catalogued and quantified. any thought outside of that is a threat to the data structure.",0.0
"a deficit is simply the result of negative cash flow. for example, if your costs are higher than your revenues, you will generate a loss in your profit &amp; loss statement and a deficit in your cash flow statement. this does not necessarily constitute a debt.

"something like this won&#39;t replace search engines. first of all this is trial and won&#39;t last long and it won&#39;t be free. a model like this, is huge. running it in a scalable manner requires huge amount of compute power, way more than what is required for search engines. finally search engines index the pages as they come to internet so they have access to the newest information on the internet. this model is trained on a data up to 2021. the reason for that is that, it took about a year to train these models. this shows how difficult it is to train these. imagine you will need to wait one year before your ai can access the specific topic you are interested in. does not seem practical. i would expect these types of models merge with some already existing search engines to enhance the experience.",0.0

"i have never understood why a linear regression was dubbed a part of the &#39;machine learning&#39; toolbox. there is no learning (i.e. more accurate predictions as the model is applied to another set of data. the model gets better with more data, but that is because of the properties of the estimator). indeed, we even have a closed-form solution for the linear regression : beta=(x&#39;x) *(x&#39;y) ^(-1)! any numerical optimization will therefore be inferior to it.i believe that one should simply say that ""linear regression is taken from econometrics"". granted, to deepen the body of knowledge in machine learning, one needs to start somewhere, but claiming that a linear regression is machine learning is, in my view, an overstatement. or is machine learning simply numerical optimization?",1.0

awesome video and explanation of real-life use of matrices!,
can you spend some time talking about computer graphics and how they are related to matrices .... i have been programming computer graphics and doing tutorials on it but have only touched on 2 dimensions and would be interested in some 3d info.,
"i just started algebra ii without the knowledge of matrices (really dumb move), but this playlist helped me a lot",
i never realized the depth of these lessons until i started following along,
the movie is mind blowing but i love the math way of the matrix as well :d,
"this is at the heart of all 3d games, alongside quaternions (shudders).  learn it because you&#39;ll need it.",
the one is the sum of a remainder of an unbalanced equation inherent to the programming of the matrix,
what if i told you khan academy is awesome?,
part 2: how matrices help you to dodge a bullet :),
"so, a matrix is the most compact way of representing numbers, and that&#39;s why it&#39;s used everywhere?",
"thank you khan, very very much!",
"ok, you&#39;re right :) but a notable favouritism for primes.  it was the primeness that struck me, really, but i said &#39;even&#39; because of the pi.  oh, sorry, zero is not a prime either!",
"i think that as long as everyone understands, spelling shouldn&#39;t really matter.",
i thought this was going explain a theory of life in &quot;the matrix&quot;. so psyc courses do cover it,
 ,
holy crap the first minute of google autotranslation was almost spot on.,
"that&#39;s all fine and nice sal, but no one can be told what the matrix is, you have to see it for yourself",
when you know matrices...you won&#39;t need to.,
"i needed some help with my algebra 1 class on this topic (i was absent) and i saw this and read pre calculus, i&#39;m not supposed to take pre calc for 3 more years-",
i have a circuit design book from college it introduces somethin about circuits and programming or somethin idk maybe this stuff will help me understand it better i dunno ,
99% comments - matrix movie jokes0.9% - more matrix jokes0.1% - this matrix joke,
"you know whats funny, this doesnt have spanish subtitles",
probably linear algebra.,
which playlists is this a part of?,
i cant believe they put pre calculus stuff on my tests...,
what the difference between a matrix and array?,
"why cant i hear audio on this video and others on khan channel?, it seems to be only khan academy where  audio isnt working. using chrome.btw other vids from other channels working perfectly fine.thx ",
i know it. he is the one!,
"what has he got against even numbers? 
",
"there is a mistake in this video: only one matrix movie exists.
one movie and some relly bad errors from the same authors.",
obligatory &quot;the matrix didn&#39;t have any sequels&quot; joke,
hi! can you give me a &#39;-5&#39;  ?,
oh so the robots use the matrix :),
skip to 2:50 to skip him teaching u about wether a matrix is 2x3 or a 4x4,
"i was dead on, he said the same thing in  the video.",
:),
matroid..! yesss..!,
he did use 0 so...,
is this high school or college level? i don&#39;t remember learning or hearing about this in high school,
colums?,
"so, there is a spoon after all ... ",
...modular programming,
you&#39;re obviously new here.,
whoa..,
who is the teacher?,
"the matrix isn&#39;t real, neo",
who else noticed the word &quot;columns&quot; was written as colums which is the wrong spelling.,
&quot;whoa&quot;,
"yes,so did i,i&#39;ll report it as misleading...not really ",
im in grade 9. what the heck am i doing here ,
he can&#39;t spell columns,
array&lt;arr,
misspelled columns,
i love you !,
"few years to late
",
"is he muted on yours..?
",
atleast spell columns right,
people here in 2023?,
j,
"whenever i&#39;m struggling with math, i always come to khan academy.i don&#39;t think i would have graduated college without these videos, so really and truly thank you!",
"you are helping me a lot, thanks.",
"thanks, little by little i am managing to understand!",
even after graduation  large chunk indian students don&#39;t know this .,
it&#39;s easy and crazy to learn,
thanks,
you need quite a sharp eye to differentiate between the 2 similar matrices,
,
grocery matrix,
"so if you&#39;re traveling to new york city, do your shopping before you go",
i wish i can thank the person who created this channel!in person! ,
i understand the way you explain more than my teacher,
"thank you so much, you saved my life :d",
it did not change the structure of the matrix. only the one can do that.,
even mathematicians use dark mode lol,
it was top row and middle column though.,
thank you,
i have a test tomorrow and i am doing this right now lmao,
why is it called the matrix multiplication? is there something to do with vectors and scalars? @khan academy,
,
is there a way on ipad to watch this video at double speed?  i know how on a pc or a mac but can&#39;t find a way on ipad.,
you can&#39;t cross a mosquito and a mountain climber. a mountain climber is a scalar.,
haha wow :d,
what do you get when you cross a mountain climber and a mosquito?,
youy&#39;re the first person all day who knew that.,
lool very hard stuff,
wut does19+1 eecwal?,
it&#39;s not rocket science... it&#39;s scalar multiplication.,
i think youve upset old al qida ;),
"wth..!! &quot; middle row top column...!! &quot; @ 2:00
it&#39;s top row and middle column",
lol,
i luv u,
301st,
301st,
"one thing i really like about sal is his incredible ability to understand his students - he knows exactly when people would normally start asking themselves questions and feeling slightly insecure about certain topics, and then he instantly gives an example on that.",
cool point about how matrix operations are undefined if the matrices are of different dimensions. thanks for the info.,
excellent education . its so brilliantly explained and easy to understand,
would you please make a video for determinants and matrices together?,
"very useful for concept building
",
you forgot to mention that matrix subtraction is not commutative just like regular subtraction.,
what if you just used 0 place holders for the matrix with different dimensions? that would be logical to me.,
"he always says &quot;i hope i helped you a little bit&quot; but he doesn&#39;t realize how much of a huge huge help he is to everyone out here!! thank you, sal khan!!!",1.0
9 years later and he still helps people understand this kind of stuff better than a teacher can.,1.0
"an easy way to remember it is is that velocity and vectors, who both contain directions, both begin with the letter &quot;v&quot;; scalars and speed, who do not contain a specified direction, both begin with the letter &quot;s&quot;. hope that clears any confusion with them. :d",1.0
does this guy know about every single concept on earth?? good teaching!,1.0
my physics teacher took 1 hour to explain this and made it more complicated than it was. thank you.,1.0
"sir! when i did physics in school i thought i would collapse from boredom. but you have succeeded in making me interested in it. i&#39;d like to thank you not just for this, but for motivating me to actually informally study physics to a greater degree.",1.0
sometimes i think that the teachers on youtube and other online sources make things more clear than the ones at school... but that might just be me :i,1.0
spending my summer watching these beautiful tutorials and teaching myself physics! :),1.0
"i took physics last year as a part of my major, and i decided to just watch a few seconds of this video to see what sal goes over (just came from calculus derivatives videos), and...within like 1 minute, he taught vectors and scalars so, so much simpler than how we learned in class. thank you so much!subscribed!!! i may be watching every day now! :-)",1.0
"im an aspiring physicist and i cannot stress how helpful these videos are! thank you, khan academy!",1.0
"sal, youve helped me so much in algebra throughout the years and now youre helping me pass physics. thank you so much, this video clearly explained what my teacher has failed to explain for weeks, and in so much less time!",1.0
i am so thankful i havent done physics in 2 years and going to college in sept so im touching up on my physics which was already bad but now its so much easier with this khan academy thank you man it means a lot :),1.0
"sir, i really think everything you do is incredibly helpful, how you educate people with your videos. physics has been around for a long time and mathematics as well. i enjoy mathematics and physics as well.",1.0
asked the professor a question and he replied with &quot;you should know this.. if no one answers i will leave and not teach!&quot; and it was just stressful. i am bad at math and my confidence is at the all time low when it comes to academics. -_- thanks so much for this video. you explain things well and its really easy to understand. its nice having someone explain things without telling me im stupid while they&#39;re at it.. ,1.0
"funny that you should be talking about both vectors and scalars. analyzing &quot;motion&quot;, with the intention of discovering what it truly is,  i eventually ended up using both vectors and scalars, and i simultaneously stacked each of these on top of each other to represent motion of an existing object as it moves across time-space. within minutes, this simple geometric representation of the motion of an object allowed me to derive all of the special relativity mathematical equations.",1.0
yes! i was having so much trouble at school! thanks! i got an a on my test because of this! i think you have taught me more in the 8 minutes that i watched in this video than the professor has in the whole semester!,1.0
"your videos are simply amazing, i want to literally sit by my computer all day and learn. thank you. i don&#39;t hate school anymore!",1.0
thank you!!!!! 11 years later and this is still so relevant!!!,1.0
soo cool.... this video really helped me .... now i dont need to worry about physics... khan you are the saviour of we students... thank you soo much buddy !! countinue your noble work man.... ^_^,1.0
excellent vid as usual. this is something that should be the first thing out of every teachers mouth on the first day of phy 101. seriously so important to understand this.,1.0
"i have watched many video tutors but tbh i do not think i have seen anyone who explains stuff as good as you do. youalways answer why stuff are the way it is being presented,during your explanation. last year i passed linear algebra from just watching your videos. but now i wish there was more of those videos for mechanics of materials.",1.0
"thank you for this video, it helped a lot. and an even bigger thank you for having good subtitles - it is now easier for me to revise in a loud household :)",1.0
"wow, thanks for that extremely helpful and enlightening comment. i wish there were more people like you around to encourage those who are aspiring to help others and also those who wish to learn more. oh wait. ",1.0
"i&#39;ve just subscribed to your channel, i&#39;m hoping to switch degrees to computer games development and for it i need to learn about matrices and vectors, i&#39;ve got matrices down but only a few days now to get to grips with vectors and i find your videos quite helpful. time to binge watch.",1.0
this was actually so helpful. my physics teacher always goes off topic but blames us for doing bad.  she&#39;s so discouraging,1.0
"your online courses are awesome.

i am also waiting for tensors!",1.0
"wow, this is a very educational video! thanks for expanding my knowledge of physics!",1.0
i wish this was around when i was taking physics; that class was so hard. i got a low c. khan academy is helping me now b/c i&#39;m currently doing independent study. thank you sal!!!!,1.0
this is really really helpful especially in thus pandemic. we are utilizing online learning.,1.0
great lesson enjoyed throughly,1.0
this channel is literally life changing.,1.0
how did society be blessed with a man like mr. khan! ,1.0
this channel drains out much of my frustration and helps me do good in studies :) thank you so much for your brilliant explanaition ,1.0
"very cool, big ups to khan academy for doing what you do. thank you for the lessons. one area i think you could improve is the sound quality of the lectures. i don&#39;t know what kind of microphone and other gear was used or what processing was done etc. but the sound could be warmer and fuller to make it easier on the ears.",0.0
never taken a bit of physics and i understood that perfectly. excellent job.,1.0
i have just started my sports science course at uni and find these videos very useful. thanks,1.0
"draws in green &quot;let me just draw this in a more earth color&quot;draws in yellow &quot;there we go, green&quot;but seriously, great video! khan academy is a lifesaver for students",1.0
this is really helpful just as a refresher for over the summer holidays. now i can go back to school fresh and remembering stuff i learnt already :),1.0
"thank you very much khan ji, i could absolutely understand the difference between vector and scalar quantity in crystal clear. ",1.0
"you helped me get through my precal class and i foresee you helping get me through my physics class, so thanks for that. :-) ",1.0

thanks  for this beautiful explanation!! i really helped me a lot ,1.0
"1:55 &quot;when we&#39;re referring to moving something or how much something has, i guess, changed its position, and i don&#39;t give you the direction, we&#39;re talking about distance!...and i&#39;m-- i&#39;m as-- assuming you&#39;ve heard the word distance.&quot;i thought this was really funny. love your videos, sal khan! they&#39;re revolutionary to learning. :)",1.0
excellent. very informative and to the point.,1.0
i know it is a cliche but u and other youtubers who dedicate their channels to teaching the specific knowledge and insights are near and dear to my heart. what more can i ask for?,1.0
"thank you so much! i really was confused with this topic and i am writing a test tomorrow ,now i understand. thank you",1.0
"i typed, &quot;grade 11 science lesson&quot; so that i came here. and i just wanted to say that this was so amazing.  i think i&#39;ll be ready for this coming school year. because we are the first batch of k-12 here in the ph, so it&#39;s somewhat frustrating and exciting at the same time. so, thanks alot po. ",1.0
"i subscribe to many channels but this one is my favorite! i truly want to learn at school but it&#39;s so hard for me but you make everything so much simpler! and, bonus, i can plug my phone into the aux cord and listen to you talk on my way to school before a big test!!",1.0
what&#39;s even more amazing is his mouse control. i can&#39;t even draw like that with a pencil.,1.0
"thank you, sal! this has all become so clear to me after watching this video :d",1.0
"so im trying to pass my ged math test failed twice. forgot algebra and the basics. came here to learn some parts of math so i can learn and remember. these vids are pretty informative and so far i&#39;ve learned how to solve for time. speed, velocity, distance apart and ratios. thanks for the info !",1.0
loved it...u were really awesome...i understood the whole concept perfectly,1.0
it was helpful!!i understood my tachers but not fully.yours was pretty good i must say!,1.0

thank for for this video.  i sometimes use khan videos in my physics class so my  students have another perspective.,1.0
love this channel. helps me refresh my memory and revise for so many subjects and topics. thanks khan academy!,1.0
"i&#39;ve been a khanacademy watcher for years; it&#39;s helped me pass, and get a+&#39;s on so many tests/quizzes. sometimes i just sit and wonder, whats the catch? the poor man works so hard to help out millions, but doesn&#39;t get anything in return. i hope this benefits him, and i hope god blesses him for helping so man. ",1.0
realistically i learned more in this video than within a 75 minute class.,1.0
"wow, i wish i found this channel a little earlier. i never thought i&#39;d understand math, i think this is already calculus, idk. but i never thought i&#39;d feel at ease watching this. wow, thank you.",1.0
"when i was first expose to physics classes and came to knowhow essential it is to see what d teacher is writing i felt very bad as i couldn&#39;t see. the first class was of vectors, d very base of physics. therefore i had to suffer for a entire year and lost interest in physics as well as my life. then i came to know about khan academy which brought me back to life",1.0
"i think rate relates to time. speed is the rate of change of position i.e. how long it takes to go from a to b (miles/hour) and acceleration is the rate of change of speed (how long it takes to change from one speed to another) so for me, rate means time.",0.0
"this channel is a life saver. my professor is cool and all, and i&#39;m sure he knows what he&#39;s talking about, but he&#39;s not very good at explaining things, which leaves most of our class in constant confusion. at least i know i can come here to help fill in the blanks. :)",1.0
you are the best educational instructer i have ever seen on youtube and you are much more clear than my teachers why can&#39;t they be that clear too i would be getting a+ all the time if my teachers were this clear,1.0
"sometimes i wonder if these dislikes are from human with brain cells. can anyone who is, or has disliked this video explain why?as, i liked it not just for the effort of teaching, seriously like this video just for this man&#39;s voice..thank you sir. ..",1.0
"hey could you do a video on the 4 factors affecting a vibrating strings?its so confusing,thank you",1.0
hey man thx a lottt!!! u cleared my doubt for my iit exam nd covered one topic.....thx a lot ,1.0
oh my god! words can&#39;t even describe how clear and enlightening you are! but numbers can: (from the scale of 1-10:) 11/10!,1.0
this guy would be like the best physics teacher ever  i havent understood this for like 2 weeks and ive learnt so much in like 10 minutes,1.0
just suggestions..your videos really help me out but perhaps when you mention a previous video could you put the link also?also make your playlists more specific like quantum physics etc,0.0
"hi guys, i am 28 years old but i majored in accounting in university. i have discovered im intj (i understand the criticism of myers briggs but i can sense theres a lot of it that holds up especially as its based on carl jungs theories). i have decided to follow my passions and start learning physics again. i did physics and math in secondary school. i was wondering if these courses would be a good place to start again and look for university courses right after? thanks",1.0
i&#39;ve learned more in this video than my physics teacher has taught me in 9 months.,1.0
"i finally understand what vector from despicable me meant. &quot;vector, both direction and magnitude!!!&quot;. thank you",1.0
wow this guy just taught me what my prof. took 3 hours today on in lab to teachlove this guy :),1.0
# sir your vedios have helped me a lot in physics to understand the concepts .i request you to make a vedio proving that pulling is easier than pushing.thank you,1.0
i&#39;ve learnt more in these 10 minutes than i have all year.,1.0
this guy is much better than my this years teacher i&#39;m in top set but get nothing but khan academy is helping more in 5 minutes than what a teacher could do in 5 lessons,1.0
"thanks mr.khan , you did a great job",1.0
"i love you, sal khan.you and bill nye deserve medals of honor from the us government for being amazing.",1.0
 thank you sir. your explanation much more greater than our teachers.,1.0
"dear salman, do you realize how amazing it is that you use dark backgrounds and color-coding? do you? dark background = easy to read. color-coding = easy to chunk information and make sense of it. thank you very much for your work!!",1.0
school teachers only explain .but the this academy is mindblowing.awesome.all my doubts get solved in seconds.thank u very much.i love this academy.keep it up.,1.0
thank you! my mind has been soaking up knowledge so fast that i&#39;ve had a hard time finding enough info. i love your video&#39;s! rock-on!,1.0
"no words, simply awesome khan academy ",1.0
this is way better than my teachers its more explained,1.0
it&#39;s so nice how he does it on the board because it&#39;s easy to take notes.,1.0
"i dont know if its the repetition, or the example, but i feel like i understand the difference between velocity and speed better from this than my text book.",1.0
thank you for your detailed videos!,1.0
you&#39;re saving me during my mcat studying. thank you so much!,1.0
"sir, u made physics easy !.....thnx for teaching ...u r great.!!",1.0
khan academy is the best!!!!,1.0
thank you for t his lecture! saved me from being perplexed with physics..,1.0
goodness me. my teacher in school never explained this much clearly to me ever. and so far i had understanding that speed and velocity are the same things. thanks for clearing it up.,1.0
this is so helpful!! thank you.,1.0
i&#39;m currently taking a physics class for my last semester of college. i&#39;m hoping khan academy can help me pass once again,1.0
khan academy is such a good help at physics.,1.0
since physics is a total bitch to me but at least khan academy helped me out for the first part although i have to be prepared for my first exam in college physics! thanks!! :),1.0
so much helpful! unfortunately i&#39;ve got a new physics teacher but lke he doesn&#39;t teach us prperly- actually tbh  i didn&#39;t understand anything for vectors...but like now i seem to be much more confident in dealing with vectors and scalars after watching this tutorial. many thanks frm nz!,1.0
